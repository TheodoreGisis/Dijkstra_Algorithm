# Dijkstra_Algorithm
## What is Dijkstra algorithm
Dijkstra is an algorithm for finding the the shortest path between nodes in a graph.This algorithm created back to 1956 by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra.For more details Dijkstra’s algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that generates every single route through the graph, and then selects the route that has the lowest overall cost.
This works by iteratively calculating a distance for each node in the graph, starting from the start node, and continuing until we reach the end node. In every iteration we have a “current node,” and we compute a new best score for every node that can be reached from it.
